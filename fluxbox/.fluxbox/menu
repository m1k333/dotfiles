# If you read this it means you want to edit this file manually, so here
# are some useful tips:
#
# - You can add your own menu-entries to ~/.fluxbox/usermenu
#
# - If you miss apps please let me know and I will add them for the next
#   release.
#
# - The -r option prevents removing of empty menu entries and lines which
#   makes things much more readable.
#
# - To prevent any other app from overwriting your menu
#   you can change the menu name in ~/.fluxbox/init to:
#     session.menuFile: ~/.fluxbox/my-menu
